Giacomo (pronounced jack-a-mo) is a postdoc at the University of Cambridge, based in the the [Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience Group](https://sites.google.com/site/blakemorelab).

I research the socioeconomic and environmental predictors of wellbeing in childhood & adolescence, using advanced quantitative methods and large-scale secondary datasets. I am also interested in quantitative research methods, particularly multivariate and Bayesian statistical methods, and how they can be applied to improve how we measure psychological constructs.
