Giacomo (pronounced jack-a-mo) is a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Kings College London, based in the INHERIT group at the Social, Genetic & Developmental Psychiatry Centre.

I research the socioeconomic and environmental predictors of wellbeing in childhood & adolescence, using advanced quantitative methods and large-scale secondary datasets. I am also interested in quantitative research methods, particularly multivariate and Bayesian statistical methods, and how they can be applied to improve how we measure psychological constructs.
