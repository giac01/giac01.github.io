    "text": "Many developmental science studies have the following setup.\nWe start with a cognitive skill that we think is important for a particular outcome. Let’s use the example of “number sense” measured using a non-symbolic number discrimination task. We hypothesise that this cognitive skill is particularly important for influencing a specific outcome, let’s say mathematical ability.\nA problem with cognitive variables is that individuals who do well on one test of cognitive or academic performance, generally do well on others. This phenomenon has been termed the positive manifold.\nOne explanation for the positive manifold is that individual’s have some general cognitive ability (or “general intelligence”) that causes performance on all other cognitive skills.\nSo, going back to our example study, a standard way of testing whether our cognition of interest (number sense) is important for our outcome of interest (mathematics) is to run a multivariable regression analysis with number sense and “IQ” as predictors, and mathematics ability as the outcome variable. Usually, “IQ” is measured using a nonverbal reasoning assessment.\nWhat could possibly go wrong? Let’s explore this using a causal diagram."

    "text": "Residual Confounding\nLet’s hypothesise that general cognitive ability causes one to have better number sense, nonverbal reasoning and mathematics skills and that neither number sense nor nonverbal reasoning have causal effects on mathematics. Let’s assume multiple other factors independently cause number sense, nonverbal reasoning, and mathematics skills. Because these other causes are not in our model, we can represent them as random “error” terms.\n\n\nCode\n# Install the necessary packages if they are not already installed\nif (!require(ggdag)) {\n  install.packages(\"ggdag\")\n  library(ggdag)\n} else {\n  library(ggdag)\n}\n\n# Define the DAG structure\ndag &lt;- dagify(\n  NS ~ GCA + Err_NS,\n  NVR ~ GCA + Err_NVR,\n  Math ~ GCA + Err_MA,\n  coords = list(\n    x = c(GCA = 0, NS = 1, NVR = 1, Math = 2, Err_NS = 1, Err_NVR = 1, Err_MA = 3),\n    y = c(GCA = 0, NS = 1, NVR = -1, Math = 0, Err_NS = 2, Err_NVR = -2, Err_MA = 0)\n  )\n)\n\n# Plot the DAG using ggdag\nggdag(dag, node_size = 20) +\n  geom_dag_text() +\n  theme_dag() + \n  ggplot2::labs(title = \"Hypothesised Causal Diagram\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, general cognitive ability (GCA) is a common cause of number sense (NS) and mathematics (Math). We will simulate data when neither number sense nor nonverbal reasoning have direct causal effects on mathematics. Therefore, if our analyses are appropriate, we should conclude that number sense has no specific causal effect on mathematics.\nIn the real world, we rely on proxy measures such as nonverbal reasoning because we cannot measure general cognitive ability directly. However nonverbal reasoning is an imperfect measure of general cognitive ability because it has other causes (which we have termed “Err_NVR”), such as perhaps previous experience with abstract reasoning assessments, mood at the time of testing, background noise, etc.\nAs we will see, if we try to control for a covariate (e.g., general cognitive ability) using a proxy measure that imperfectly measures the covariate (e.g., nonverbal reasoning performance), we will not fully adjust for confounding. This artefact is called residual confounding.\nWe can simulate what happens in R when we use multivariable regression to test for an association between number sense and mathematics under two conditions. In the first condition, we control for general cognitive ability, and in the second condition we control for nonverbal reasoning.\nTo simulate this model in R, we start with exogenous variables (variables that do not have a cause in the model) and work towards our endogenous variables caused by our previously simulated variables:\nModel Simulation Code\n\nset.seed(10)\n\nsample_size = 100000\n\ngca      = rnorm(sample_size)\nerr_ns   = rnorm(sample_size)\nerr_nvr  = rnorm(sample_size)\nerr_math = rnorm(sample_size)\n\nnvr = gca + err_nvr\nns  = gca + err_ns\nmath = gca + err_math\n\ndf_sim = data.frame(gca, nvr, ns, math)\n\nLet’s run a multiple regression analyses predicting mathematics:\n\nmodel0 = lm(math ~ ns + gca, data = df_sim)\nmodel1 = lm(math ~ ns + nvr, data = df_sim)\n\nsummary(model0)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = math ~ ns + gca, data = df_sim)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-4.3696 -0.6787 -0.0029  0.6750  4.1727 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

However when we control for nonverbal reasoning instead of GCA, there is a highly significant effect of number sense on math (beta ≈ .33).\nIn the real world we cannot control for general cognitive ability directly, we can only use proxy measures like nonverbal reasoning. However, because nonverbal reasoning is an imperfect measure of general cognitive ability, it doesn’t fully adjust for confounding! Residual confounding even occurs when we have measured all the relevant confounding variables, but our measurements have some measurement error.\nIn this example, the reliability of nonverbal reasoning was relatively poor. We can measure its reliability by calculating the squared correlation with general cognitive ability. In this case the reliability is 50%.\nReliability of nonverbal reasoning for measuring GCA:\n\ncor(gca, nvr)^2\n\n[1] 0.4986983\n\n\n\nDoes increasing the reliability of our covariate help?\nIf we increase the reliability of our covariate (NVR), this will reduce the amount of residual confounding. However, even if reliability is excellent, if it is less than 100% reliable (100% reliability = no measurement error), we will still see some residual confounding.\nLet’s rerun the simulation and, increase the reliability of NVR to 90% and see what happens.\nWe can increase the reliability of nonverbal reasoning by reducing the variance of the error_nvr term. We can do this by setting nvr = gca  + 1/3*err_nvr.\n\nset.seed(10)\n\nsample_size = 100000\n\ngca      = rnorm(sample_size)\nerr_ns   = rnorm(sample_size)\nerr_nvr  = rnorm(sample_size)\nerr_math = rnorm(sample_size)\n\nnvr = gca  + 1/3*err_nvr # see https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=.9+%3D+1%2F%281%2Ba%5E2%29 \nns  = gca  + err_ns\nmath = gca + err_math\n\ndf_sim = data.frame(gca, nvr, ns, math)\n\ncat(\"Reliability of NVR for measuring GCA = \",round(cor(nvr, gca)^2,3))\n\nReliability of NVR for measuring GCA =  0.9\n\nmodel0 = lm(math ~ ns, data = df_sim)\nmodel1 = lm(math ~ ns + nvr, data = df_sim)\n\nsummary(model1)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = math ~ ns + nvr, data = df_sim)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-4.3178 -0.7115 -0.0040  0.7091  4.0562 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.
