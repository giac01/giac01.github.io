    "text": "Many developmental science studies have the following setup.\nWe start with some cognitive skill that we think is important for learning. For example, lets say its one’s “number sense” measured using a non-symbolic number discrimination task. We hypothesise that this cognitive skill is particularly important for predicting a specific outcome, let’s say mathematical ability.\nA problem with cognitive variables is that individuals who do well on one test of cognitive or academic performance, generally do well on others. This phenomenon has been termed the positive manifold.\nOne explanation for the positive manifold is that individual’s have some general cognitive ability (or “general intelligence”) that causes performance on all other cognitive skills.\nSo, going back to our example study, a standard way of testing whether our cognition of interest (number sense) is important for our outcome of interest (mathematics) is to run a multivariable regression analysis with number sense and “IQ” as predictors, and mathematics ability as the outcome variable. Usually, “IQ” is measured using a non-verbal reasoning assessment.\nWhat could possibly go wrong? Let’s explore this using a causal diagram."

    "text": "Residual Confounding\nLet hypothesise that general cognitive ability causes one to have better number sense, non-verbal reasoning and mathematics skills, and that neither number sense or non-verbal reasoning have causal effects of mathematics. Let’s assume there multiple other factors that independently cause number sense, non-verbal reasoning, and mathematics skills. Because these other causes are not in our model, we can represent them as random “error” terms.\n\n\nCode\n# Install the necessary packages if they are not already installed\nif (!require(ggdag)) {\n  install.packages(\"ggdag\")\n  library(ggdag)\n} else {\n  library(ggdag)\n}\n\n# Define the DAG structure\ndag &lt;- dagify(\n  NS ~ GCA + Err_NS,\n  NVR ~ GCA + Err_NVR,\n  Math ~ GCA + Err_MA,\n  coords = list(\n    x = c(GCA = 0, NS = 1, NVR = 1, Math = 2, Err_NS = 1, Err_NVR = 1, Err_MA = 3),\n    y = c(GCA = 0, NS = 1, NVR = -1, Math = 0, Err_NS = 2, Err_NVR = -2, Err_MA = 0)\n  )\n)\n\n# Plot the DAG using ggdag\nggdag(dag, node_size = 20) +\n  geom_dag_text() +\n  theme_dag() + \n  ggplot2::labs(title = \"Hypothesised Causal Diagram\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, general cognitive ability (GCA) acts as a common cause of number sense (NS) and non-verbal reasoning (NVR). Neither number sense or non-verbal reasoning have direct causal effects on mathematics.\nBecause we cannot measure general cognitive ability directly, we can only control for non-verbal reasoning. However, because non-verbal reaosning is not a perfect measure of general cognitive ability, it will not perfectly adjust for confounding! Non-verbal reasoning isn’t a perfect measure of general cognitive ability because there are other variables outside of our model that independently cause non-verbal reasoning, which we have termed “Err_NVR” above.\nWe can simulate what happens in R when we use multivariable regression to test for an association between number sense and mathematics under two conditions. In the first condition, we will also include general cognitive ability as a covariate, and in the second condition we will use non-verbal reasoning as a proxy measure of general cognitive ability.\nTo simulate this model in our we have to start with exogenous variables (variables that do not have a cause in the model) and work towards our endogenous variables caused by our previously simulated variables:\nModel Simulation Code\n\nset.seed(10)\n\nsample_size = 100000\n\ngca      = rnorm(sample_size)\nerr_ns   = rnorm(sample_size)\nerr_nvr  = rnorm(sample_size)\nerr_math = rnorm(sample_size)\n\nnvr = gca + err_nvr\nns  = gca + err_ns\nmath = gca + err_math\n\ndf_sim = data.frame(gca, nvr, ns, math)\n\nLet’s run a multiple regression analyses predicting mathematics:\n\nmodel0 = lm(math ~ ns + gca, data = df_sim)\nmodel1 = lm(math ~ ns + nvr, data = df_sim)\n\nsummary(model0)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = math ~ ns + gca, data = df_sim)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-4.3696 -0.6787 -0.0029  0.6750  4.1727 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

However when we control for non-verbal reasoning instead of GCA, the effect only decreases slightly (beta ≈ .33).\nBecause in practice (outside of simulations) we cannot control for general cognitive ability directly, we can only use proxy measures like non-verbal reasoning. However, because non-verbal reasoning is an imperfect measure of general cognitive ability, it doesn’t fully adjust for confounding!\nIn this example, the reliability of non-verbal reasoning was relatively poor. We can measure its reliability by calculating the squared correlation with general cognitive ability. In this case the reliability is 50%.\nReliability of non-verbal reasoning for measuring GCA:\n\ncor(gca, nvr)^2\n\n[1] 0.4986983\n\n\n\nDoes increasing reliability of our covariate help?\nIf we increase the reliability of our covariate (NVR) this will reduce the amount of residual confounding. However, even if reliability is really good, if it is less than 100% reliable (i.e. no measurement error) then we will still see some residual confounding.\nLet’s rerun the simulation and increase the reliability of NVR to 90% and see what happens.\n\nset.seed(10)\n\nsample_size = 100000\n\ngca      = rnorm(sample_size)\nerr_ns   = rnorm(sample_size)\nerr_nvr  = rnorm(sample_size)\nerr_math = rnorm(sample_size)\n\nnvr = gca  + 1/3*err_nvr # see https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=.9+%3D+1%2F%281%2Ba%5E2%29 \nns  = gca  + err_ns\nmath = gca + err_math\n\ndf_sim = data.frame(gca, nvr, ns, math)\n\ncat(\"Reliability of NVR for measuring GCA = \",round(cor(nvr, gca)^2,3))\n\nReliability of NVR for measuring GCA =  0.9\n\nmodel0 = lm(math ~ ns, data = df_sim)\nmodel1 = lm(math ~ ns + nvr, data = df_sim)\n\nsummary(model1)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = math ~ ns + nvr, data = df_sim)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-4.3178 -0.7115 -0.0040  0.7091  4.0562 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

Number sense still appears as a “significant” predictor of math skills, although its effect is much smaller now (Beta ≈ .9)"
