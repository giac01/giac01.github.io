# Making nice correlation plots in ggplot2

A correlation matrix is the backbone of a lot of statistical methods. Therefore, having nice ways to present correlation matrices in papers is quite handy.

Even though there are a few great R packages for creating correlation matrix plots, creating them directly in ggplot2 allows a lot more flexibility.

A nice property of Pearson's correlation coefficient is that you all only need two pieces of informatjion

```{r}

data(mtcars)

head(mtcars)

df = mtcars

cor(mtcars)
```

## Standard approach

```{r}
corrplot::corrplot(cor(df), addCoef.col = 'black')

```

## Ggplot

```{r}

gbtoolbox::plot_correlations(df)
```
